VanillaGuideReloaded
====================
VanillaGuideReloaded aim to cover the hole for an in-game guide for Vanilla WoW. The AddOn features:

* Step-by-Step Zone Guides (Sage - Alliance only)
* Hints and Tips for various Quests
* [TomTom TWOW](https://github.com/laytya/TomTom-TWOW) Integration

> **NOTE:**
>
> - This Addon is developed for WoW 1.12.1 (toc 11200), also known as Vanilla WoW 
>

Usage
=====
Guide will automatically load when you log in.
You can select another guide with the menu at the bottom.
I also suggest to bind keys for the next / prev step in Keyboard shortcuts.

Known Bug
=========
The arrow will only indicate the direction of the next step if you have TomTom TWOW installed.
I'm working on a port of Guidelime (from scratch) with better arrow support (https://github.com/JeromeM/GuidelimeVanilla)
